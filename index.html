				<p>“Deep in the meadow, hidden far away <br>
A cloak of leaves, a moonbeam ray <br>
Forget your woes and let your troubles lay <br>
And when it's morning again, they'll wash away <br>
Here it's safe, here it's warm <br> 
Here the daisies guard you from every harm <br>
Here your dreams are sweet and tomorrow brings them true <br>
Here is the place where I love you.” <br>
― Suzanne Collins, The Hunger Games</p>
